# Nick's Ray Tracing Playground

A ray tracing project created with the help of the
[*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series by 
Peter Shirley, Trevor D. Black, and Steve Hollasch. You can find the blog post
I made about this project
[here](https://www.nsdigirolamo.com/posts/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend).

## Overview

This project has no external dependencies. You should be able to build it as
long as you have a compiler that supports the C++23 language standard.

## Try it Yourself

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/nsdigirolamo/ray-tracing-playground.git`
2. Navigate into the new directory with `cd ray-tracing-playground`
3. Compile with `make`
4. Run with `./ray-tracer`
