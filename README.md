# Nick's Ray Tracing Playground

A ray tracing project created with the help of the
[*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io/) book series by 
Peter Shirley, Trevor D. Black, and Steve Hollasch. You can find the blog post
I made about this project
[here](https://www.nsdigirolamo.com/posts/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend).

Building this project requires a compiler that supports C++23.
